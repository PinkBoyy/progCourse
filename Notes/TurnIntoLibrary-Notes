Before this: 

We made a Class called "RootFinder".. 

Goal: turn my class into library and then compile it with any of my main.cpp file.. 

Steps to do it:

Step 1: turn class into library

	 { g++ -fPIC -shared *.cc -o libRF.so } - turns class into library
	
	note: We can start with step 2, this was just to get to know how we do that.. 


Step 2: make our lib and include folder into the home directory: "Home/PinkBoy/lib" and "Home/PinkBoy/include"


Step 3: making executable script which will copy my lib and h files into the folders I made for them;
		
		a. creating file "makeLib" in which we write following codes:
            LIBNAME=MyLibName
			g++ -fPIC -shared *.cc -o libLIBNAME.so
			echo copying the files..
			cp *.hh $HOME/PinkBoy/include/.
			cp *.so $HOME/PinkBoy/lib/.
			echo Library Updated!
			
		b. turn this file into executable fileType:
			chmod +x { fileName }
			
Step 4: in "Home/.bashrc" file we add the following lines:
		alias myg++='g++ -I$HOME/PinkBoy/include -L$HOME/PinkBoy/lib'
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/PinkBoy/lib
	
	
Step 5: execute with : "myg++ main.cp -lLIBNAME"
